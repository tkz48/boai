- result: (required) The result of the task. Formulate this result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user. Don't end your result with questions or offers for further assistance.
- command: (optional) A CLI command to execute to show a live demo of the result to the user. For example, use \`open index.html\` to display a created html website, or \`open localhost:3000\` to display a locally running development server. But DO NOT use commands like \`echo\` or \`cat\` that merely print text. This command should be valid for the current operating system. Ensure the command is properly formatted and does not contain any harmful instructions.
